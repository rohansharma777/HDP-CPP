# HDP-CPP
A exploratory project on predicting handwritten digits in C++

The aim is to predict handwritten digits using ML algorithms from scratch without using any ML libraries.

Only Libraries used (which are not standard) are:
1. Eigen ( for Linear algebraic computations)
2. OpenMVG ( for displaying images)
